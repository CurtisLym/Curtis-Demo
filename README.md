# FinTech Case Study "Shopify"
##### By Curtis Lym 

##Overview and Origin

In this case study we will be focusing on Shopify, one of the top e-commerce hosting sites in Canada(hosting over 1.7 million stores), Founded by Topbias Lutke, Daniel Weinand, and Scott Lake. Shopify is a way where small and large business owners can build their store online and offline. It is a way where businesses can sell both online, from their own websites, or in person with Shopify POS. You can think of Shopify as a facilitator, by providing a foundation where businesses can showcase products, engage with customers, accept payments and more. Shopify makes it easy for business owners to operate on the web.

However, Shopify wasn't the intended destination for its founders. Before Shopify became Shopify, it was known as Snowdevils. Topbias Lutke(one of the original founders) came from Germany to Ottawa for snowboarding, met a lovely young lady, where he settled down in Ottawa and created his own business(Didn’t make Ottawa his headquarters because of the benefits of the region but out of love!). Due to his interest in winter sports he decided to create an online store to sell snowboards(Snowdevils). While he and his founding partner Lake were trying to get their store up and running they noticed that many sites made it very difficult for them to operate online. The German native Lutke described the experience as: 

> I set up our online store based on a variety of different systems such as Miva, OsCommerce, and Yahoo stores. Truth be told, all those systems made my skin crawl because of how bad they were. The final straw was when I got a custom design made for my snowboard store and I couldn’t get it to work in Yahoo stores. We had this great CSS-based layout done with all these new fanged ‘web standards’ and the customizability of Yahoo Stores barely allowed me to change the background color of the top frame.  

(Product habits blog). Lutke, being a very talented software engineer, decided with his co-founders to help solve these issues. Once they had a solid product, they created the name “Jaded Pixel”, later on as they added more solutions to the site they changed it to what we know now as “Shopify”. A storefront intended to sell snowboards, has now become one of the largest business hosting sites next to Amazon.

##Business Activities

Shopify was originally created as an online snowboarding shop but was changed in order to solve ecommerce website development like “Yahoo store”. After the difficulty he faced with these ecommerce platforms, Lutke intended Shopify to improve on speed, simplicity and design. Their aim was towards business owners small and large. A place where all you need is an idea, something to sell and a decent internet connection, and your store can be up and running in no time. The site provides over 1200 apps with specialized features such as inventory tracking, shipping tools and a wide range of pricing plans. Due to Shopify’s simplicity, robustness of its platform and extensive partner ecosystem, it has allowed over 1.7 million people regardless of technical background to sell and buy products. 

Shopify utilizes over 79 technological products and services which includes HTML, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack. According to BuiltWith, Shopify also currently uses 153 technologies for its website. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone/Mobile compatible, and Apple Mobile Web Clips Icon. These technologies allow for easier use when browsing their website while on the computer and mobile devices. The most popular apps that are use by its users and developers, include Shop: Delivery & Order Trackers, Shopify - Ecommerce Business, Logo Maker: Designer & Create, Scratch Photos, Hatchful - Logo Maker, Shopify Point of Sale(POS), Frenzy - Buy Sneakers and More, and Shopify Ping. These software implementations have given users the ability to customize and brand their businesses the way they have envisioned. Providing more distinction and individuality between the businesses that are operating on Shopify.
