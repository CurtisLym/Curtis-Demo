# FinTech Case Study "Shopify"
##### By Curtis Lym 

**Overview and Origin**

In this case study we will be focusing on Shopify, one of the top e-commerce hosting sites in Canada(hosting over 1.7 million stores), Founded by Topbias Lutke, Daniel Weinand, and Scott Lake. Shopify is a way where small and large business owners can build their store online and offline. It is a way where businesses can sell both online, from their own websites, or in person with Shopify POS. You can think of Shopify as a facilitator, by providing a foundation where businesses can showcase products, engage with customers, accept payments and more. Shopify makes it easy for business owners to operate on the web.

However, Shopify wasn't the intended destination for its founders. Before Shopify became Shopify, it was known as Snowdevils. Topbias Lutke(one of the original founders) came from Germany to Ottawa for snowboarding, met a lovely young lady, where he settled down in Ottawa and created his own business(Didn’t make Ottawa his headquarters because of the benefits of the region but out of love!). Due to his interest in winter sports he decided to create an online store to sell snowboards(Snowdevils). While he and his founding partner Lake were trying to get their store up and running they noticed that many sites made it very difficult for them to operate online. The German native Lutke described the experience as: 

> I set up our online store based on a variety of different systems such as Miva, OsCommerce, and Yahoo stores. Truth be told, all those systems made my skin crawl because of how bad they were. The final straw was when I got a custom design made for my snowboard store and I couldn’t get it to work in Yahoo stores. We had this great CSS-based layout done with all these new fanged ‘web standards’ and the customizability of Yahoo Stores barely allowed me to change the background color of the top frame.[Product habits blog](https://producthabits.com/shopify-grew-snowboard-shop-10b-commerce-ecosystem/) 

Lutke, being a very talented software engineer, decided with his co-founders to help solve these issues. Once they had a solid product, they created the name “Jaded Pixel”, later on as they added more solutions to the site they changed it to what we know now as “Shopify”. A storefront intended to sell snowboards, has now become one of the largest business hosting sites next to Amazon.

**Business Activities**

Shopify was originally created as an online snowboarding shop but was changed in order to solve ecommerce website development issues. After the difficulty he faced with these ecommerce platforms, Lutke intended Shopify to improve on speed, simplicity and design. Their aim was towards business owners small and large. A place where all you need is an idea, something to sell and a decent internet connection, and your store can be up and running in no time. The site provides over 1200 apps with specialized features such as inventory tracking, shipping tools and a wide range of pricing plans. Due to Shopify’s simplicity, robustness of its platform and extensive partner ecosystem, it has allowed over 1.7 million people regardless of technical background to sell and buy products. 

Shopify utilizes over 79 technological products and services which includes HTML, Google Analytics, and jQuery, according to G2 Stack. According to BuiltWith, Shopify also currently uses 153 technologies for its website. These include Viewport Meta, IPhone/Mobile compatible, and Apple Mobile Web Clips Icon. These technologies allow for easier use when browsing their website while on the computer and mobile devices. The most popular apps that are use by its users and developers, include Shop: Delivery & Order Trackers, Shopify - Ecommerce Business, Logo Maker: Designer & Create, Scratch Photos, Hatchful - Logo Maker, Shopify Point of Sale(POS), Frenzy - Buy Sneakers and More, and Shopify Ping. These software implementations have given users the ability to customize and brand their businesses the way they have envisioned. Providing more distinction and individuality between the businesses that are operating on Shopify.    

**Landscape**

Shopify provides its users to showcase products, engage with customers, get paid, ship products, and assist in managing day-to-day finances and operations. Some ecommerce businesses use different tools in order to manage each of these activities and spend a lot of time and money focusing on combining these systems together. However, Shopify groups these systems together  and becomes the base where other applications, processes, or technologies are developed. Shopify holds all the business tools people need in one place. Due to this, Shopify operates in two FinTech domains which are personal finance and lending.

Through Personal finance, Shopify offers a series of advising plans that help to guide their business owners through operating their sites and how to sell products on their own. This allows people to operate without having to constantly be advised by third party members and can make decisions like a true owner. Also if users want to go even further with their store and consumer experience, Shopify gives access to API’s and other development tools that improve the look and functionality of their site. With shopify’s apps, business owners do not need a technical background and can fully enjoy the experience of creating an idea and selling it without having to rely on several third party members. 

Shopify also provides its own variety of lending services to users who wish for an easy and quick way to obtain funds. There are three methods in order to fund users, these methods are Payroll Funding, Inventory Funding, and Marketing Funding. Payroll funding provides users with funds to expand their employment gaps whether that's bringing on people to fill the gaps or creating a new team. Payroll funding provides users with what they need in order to build a solid team and focus on the correct growth of the business. Thom and James Elliot, who started their own pizza shop in England, utilized the payroll fund in order to fill skill gaps in their company. Described it as:

>“We've got an amazing ops director in, we've got a people's director and all of that stuff that you just have to have…[when you employ] 275 people. [(Thom Elliot, Pizza Pilgrims: 1Shopify)](https://www.shopify.com/capital-payroll-funding?utm_campaign=capital_sprint&utm_content=payroll-funding&utm_medium=landing-page&utm_source=brochure) 

The payroll funding had given Thom and James the ability to obtain members to help them manage their businesses, something that would've been more complicated through banking. 

Inventory funding gives its users a way to obtain goods and supplies in order to prepare for big seasons or to meet market demand. Zakia Torres, founder of Quartz & Rainbows, says:
 
>“Because of Shopify Capital, I’ve been able to grow during the pandemic, I've been able to add new products, and I've been able to get orders shipped out as quickly as possible. Now I have bigger goals.”[(Zakia Torres, Founder of Quartz & Rainbows: 2Shopify)](https://www.shopify.com/capital-inventory-funding?utm_campaign=capital_sprint&utm_content=inventory-funding&utm_medium=landing-page&utm_source=brochure) 

With Inventory funding users can take advantage of bulk discounts and the pre-ordering of raw materials in order to avoid supply chain delays. Store owners like Zakia didn’t have to worry about missing out the best prices due to a lack of funding, so they were able to act more effectively when obtaining materials. 

Finally, Marketing funding gives its users the ability to obtain funds in order to get their name out there. Their users can utilize the funds in order to invest in design, packaging and branding techniques. Also be able to advertise on social media networks and prepare for big campaigns or host contests for their consumers. Helena Hambrecht, Co-Founder of Haus, expressed: 

>“We weren’t old enough as a business to be approved for a (traditional) loan, and all the other types of debt financing that we explored were just terrifying... That’s when we found out about Shopify Capital.”[(Helena Price Hambrecht, Co-Founder of Haus: 3Shopify)](https://www.shopify.com/capital-marketing-funding?utm_campaign=capital_sprint&utm_content=marketing-funding&utm_medium=landing-page&utm_source=brochure)

 Shopify’s loaning service allows funding for businesses that can’t meet all the prerequisites that banks do, allowing for more obtainable funding. 

**Results**

Shopify has been quite the successful Fintech business since their founding but had received a huge boost in user subscriptions thanks to the Covid Pandemic, receiving a massive number of users that have them rivaling Amazon. What was a curse for the real world became a huge boost for the digital world, many had to adapt to the functionalities of the internet, small and large businesses had to learn to utilize and improve their virtual services, especially small businesses. Many small business owners had no choice but to switch focus to the virtual world since by avoiding it meant their business could potentially ploment. Also due to the restraints of the pandemic people had to find ways to be entertained or improve on skills through the internet. This led people to become experimental and take more risks on themselves. which led many to open that business they’ve always wanted. So many new, small and large businesses owners went looking for ecommerce platforms in order to help them manage their businesses. For most, Shopify became a beacon for developing ecommerce businesses. Due to the Pandemic, Shopify was able to surpass 1 billion dollars in revenue in 2019, this was the first time in Shopify's company history of achieving this. As of late 2019, Amazon commanded approximately 37% of U.S ecommerce sales, while Shopify was able to obtain second by achieving 6% of the market share, this put them ahead of large corporations like eBay, Walmart and Apple. Shopify has seen amazing strides during the early stage of the pandemic, catapulting this Canadian company to one of the leading ecommerce companies in the World.

**Recommendations**

Shopify has a great business foundation that provides its users with virtually whatever they need in order to correctly operate in the ecommerce space. However, the fintech company should expand its operations into Blockchain. By incorporating Blockchain to Shopify’s network, it can improve on a variety of aspects. For example, smart contracts are a self executing contract that writes the terms of all parties directly into code. This code exists on a decentralized Blockchain network and ensures that all parties in the contract do what they are supposed to do. They are self-automated which means that the program can run without any downtime and without interference from foiregn parties. This basically allows for a more efficient way of operating transactions. It ensures that your party gets paid once your end of the deal is met. Also, if parties decide to cancel trades or transactions, your goods/services are returned in full. This means that the need for lawyers, government officials, or other middle men needed to settle disputes are reduced. This gives businesses like Shopify and their users peace of mind when dealing with suspicious clients. According to a Forbes article, it introduced DLT “is a technological infrastructure that enables: 

>“simultaneous access, validation and record updating” across a network, spread across multiple locations or entities.”( Forbes Article) 

DTL allows for safe operation on a decentralized database, that helps to eliminate the need for a central third party authority to keep constant checks against fraud or manipulation. Institutions like these can help Shopify enter Blockchian technology with confidence, and reassure users that they can put more trust in their networks.
